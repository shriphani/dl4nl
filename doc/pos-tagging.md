# POS Tagging

From Wikipedia:

In corpus linguistics, part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph.
